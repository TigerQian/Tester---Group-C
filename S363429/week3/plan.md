 Here’s a 2-week learning plan to gain essential skills as a Software Test Engineer, with approximately 20 hours of study.

Skills Required:
Basic Testing Knowledge: Understand fundamental concepts and methods such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
Testing Tools: Familiarize yourself with commonly used testing tools and frameworks like Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, and JIRA.
Scripting and Programming: Ability to write test scripts and automate test cases, typically requires knowledge of one or two programming languages (e.g., Python, Java).
Defect Management: Know how to log, track, and report defects, and communicate with the development team.
Test Planning and Case Design: Create detailed test plans and test cases.
Performance Testing: Understand the basics of performance testing and tools such as JMeter.
Continuous Integration: Know how to integrate testing into a CI/CD environment.
2-Week Learning Plan (Approximately 20 Hours)
Week 1: Foundations and Tools
Day 1 (2 hours):

Testing Basics: Learn fundamental software testing concepts, testing lifecycle, and different types of testing (e.g., unit, integration, system).
Resources: Online courses (e.g., Coursera, Udacity) or books like "The Art of Software Testing".

Day 2 (2 hours):
Overview of Testing Tools: Understand common testing tools (e.g., Selenium, JUnit, TestNG). Start with an introductory tutorial for one tool.
Resources: Official documentation or introductory tutorials.

Day 3 (2 hours):
Scripting and Programming: Learn to write test scripts in a chosen programming language. Focus on how to use the language with the selected testing tool.
Resources: Official documentation for the language and testing framework.

Day 4 (2 hours):
Defect Management: Learn how to use defect tracking tools (e.g., JIRA). Understand the defect lifecycle and how to log and track defects.
Resources: JIRA official documentation or online tutorials.

Day 5 (2 hours):
Test Planning and Case Design: Learn to write test plans and design test cases. Understand how to cover various testing scenarios.
Resources: Test case design guides, books, or online tutorials.
Week 2: Practice and Advanced Topics

Day 6 (2 hours):
