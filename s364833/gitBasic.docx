Basic Git Commands
1. Setting Up Git
Initialize a Git repository in your project directory:
git init
Configure your username and email:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
2. Working with Repositories
Clone an existing repository:
git clone <repository_url>
Check the status of your repository (e.g., to see changes):
git status
View your current branch:
git branch
3. Working with Files
Add files to the staging area (preparing them for commit):
git add <file_name>
Or add all changed files:
git add .
Commit changes in the staging area with a descriptive message:
git commit -m "Your commit message"
View the commit history:
git log
4. Working with Branches
Create a new branch:
git branch <new_branch_name>
Switch to a different branch:
git checkout <branch_name>
Merge another branch into your current branch:
git merge <branch_name>
5. Working with Remote Repositories
Push your local changes to a remote repository:
git push origin <branch_name>
Pull changes from a remote repository to your local repository:
git pull origin <branch_name>
Add a remote repository:
git remote add origin <repository_url>
6. Undoing Changes
Unstage a file:
git reset <file_name>
Revert a commit (creates a new commit that undoes the changes):
git revert <commit_id>
Reset your repository to a previous commit (dangerous, use with caution):
git reset --hard <commit_id>
